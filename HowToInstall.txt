THIS IS COMPLETELY LEGAL!
It is illegal to share source files for games online, but we are using a completely LEGAL  workaround. The only legal way to share mods is to use "patches",
which are files that can be APPLIED to the original, unedited file that the user has legally obtained.
One of the most popular apps used to apply these "patches" is called "flips", which you can download here:

Here's the steps to installing this mod:
-Go to the Will You Snail page on steam
-Click properties
-Click "betas" and change the current beta to "sandbox".
-Click update.
-Go back to the properties menu. Click "Local Files".
-Click "Browse". This should open the WYS source files in your file explorer.
-Create a backup of "data.win"
-Make sure you have FLIPS downloaded. (See above)
-Open flips and click "apply patch".
-Select the dropdown at the bottom right of your file explorer that currently says "supported ROMs". Change it to "all files".
-Select the "data.bps" file from where you downloaded the mod
-Press okay
-Select the "data.win" file from the WYS source files
-Press okay
-You should get a message saying the patch was successfully applied.
-Run Will You Snail
